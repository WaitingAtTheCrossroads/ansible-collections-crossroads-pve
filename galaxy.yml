# A list of file glob-like patterns used to filter any files or directories that
# should not be included in the build artifact. A pattern is matched from the
# relative path of the file or directory of the collection directory. This uses
# 'fnmatch' to match the files or directories. Some directories and files like
# 'galaxy.yml', '*.pyc', '*.retry', and '.git' are always filtered. Mutually
# exclusive with 'manifest'
build_ignore:
  - .gitignore
  - changelogs/.plugin-cache.yaml
# A dict controlling use of manifest directives used in building the collection artifact. The key 'directives' is a
# list of MANIFEST.in style
# L(directives,https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/using-manifest-in/#manifest-in-commands). The key
# 'omit_default_directives' is a boolean that controls whether the default directives are used. Mutually exclusive
# with 'build_ignore'
# manifest: null
